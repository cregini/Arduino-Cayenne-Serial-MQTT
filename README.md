# Arduino-Cayenne-Serial-MQTT
This arduino code will allow you to send data from a DHT22 sensor running on an Arduino to the Cayenne Dashboard via serial connection.  It is important to have the Cayenne-Arduino_MQTT library installed on both your Arduino IDE and Raspberry Pi to allow for serial communication.
